This is a basic string manipulation toolkit inspired from what I did last year. This demonstrates fundamental algorithm logic--loops, conditionals, and validations-- without relying heavily on external libraries. 

Features: 
The toolkit provides a menu-driven interface with the following functions:
String Reversal – Manually reverses a string character by character.
Word Count – Counts the number of words in a sentence by detecting space transitions.
Character Count – Counts total characters (excluding whitespace).
Lower Case Converter – Converts entire string to lowercase.
Upper Case Converter – Converts entire string to uppercase.
Palindrome Checker - Checks if the string is a palindrome.
